# AI Health Engine

## Project Overview

AI Health Engine is a web-based application designed to provide instant health assessments using AI technology. Users can enter their symptoms and receive immediate insights without the need to log in or create an account. The system employs advanced algorithms to analyze the data provided and deliver actionable recommendations.

   ```bash
   git clone https://your-repo-url.git
   cd ai-health-engine
   ```
   
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser. No additional installation is required as the application is purely front-end based.
